  "description": "Makes smelting recipes always require only 1 item, but sets probability accordingly. Balance unchanged, but now you can use one smelter to smelt any ore or iron plates at once. You might ask 'Why can't I do it without this mod? Well, suppose you have a mixed belt full of iron ore and iron plates, an inserter puts 3 plates into furnace and than comes some ore, so all stucks. This mod fixes just that.'",
